# game-prototyper
Little library which allows me to create canvas game prototypes (squares, circles, texts, all of that ;))

Right now it only supports drawing squares, I will be probably extending that when I need new functionalities.

## API

- ``defaultDrawConfig`` - a set of default values (config)
- ``drawRect`` - draws rectangle on provided 2d context with provided config
- ``generateCanvas`` - generates canvas with provided width and height
- ``generateRectCanvas`` - generates canvas with drawn rectangle

For function parameters and default parameters, browse source code
